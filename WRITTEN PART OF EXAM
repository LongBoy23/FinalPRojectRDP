Math 4330 Final Project Written Part
1) Explain the differences made to Classical Gram-Schmidt to obtain Modified Gram-Schmidt. Briefly state why Modified is necessary.
    
    The first difference is that the Modified Gram-Schmidt defines everything using i.  In code there is also three forloops for Modified
    Gram-Schidt as compared to two. This helps to give a more accurate answer by reducing rounding error.
    
3) Briefly explain the concepts of Conditioning and Stability and why they are necessary.
    
    Conditioning is a way to analyze how small changes to an algorithm affect the solution.  
    There are two cases, well and ill.  
    Ill is the bad kind as it affects it the most.  
    This is necessary because it can tell you whether or not the changes
    have a significant effect.
    
    Stability is another way to check accuracy of your model using absolute error and relative error.  
    It is how a problem handles error.  
    There are two types, forward and backward.  Backwards stability is stronger than forwards.
    In practice this is extremely useful for building bridges or material composition.
